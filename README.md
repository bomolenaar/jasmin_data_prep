# jasmin_data_prep
Scripts I use to prepare speech and transcript data from the JASMIN corpus for use with Kaldi ASR

### There are three classes of files corresponding to these data:
1. jasmin_qG1 ~ JASMIN comp-q G1, this is oral reading by Group 1 (children aged 7-11)
2. jasmin_qG2 ~ JASMIN comp-q G2, this is oral reading by Group 2 (children aged 12-13**)
3. jasmin_pG1 ~ JASMIN comp-p G1, this is HMI speech by Group 1 (children aged 7-11)


** max age 13 is my own limit, Group 2 actually contains data from children up to age 18.
